node-web-scraper
================

Simple web scraper to fetch various data from the web.  Forked from [this excellent tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js)

To run this example use the following commands:

``` shell
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```

 Then it will start up our node server, navigate to http://localhost:8081/wikipedia-school-shootings and see what happens.
