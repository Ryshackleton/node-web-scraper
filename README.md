wiki-web-scraper
================

Simple web scraper to fetch various data from the web.  Currently contains a few routes to scrape data from specific wikipedia pages and do some rough geocoding based on city names.

Forked from [this excellent tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js).

To run this example use the following commands:

``` shell
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```

 This starts a node server on port 3000, where you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/wikipedia-school-shootings and see what happens.
